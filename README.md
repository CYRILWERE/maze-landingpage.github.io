The landing page for the maze game introduces the game, allows players to select a difficulty level, and provides instructions on how to play. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the landing page works:

HTML Structure
HTML: The HTML file (index.html) structures the content of the landing page.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type and HTML version.
The <head> section includes meta information, the page title, and a link to the CSS file (styles.css).
The <body> section contains the main content:
A container div that holds the title, a welcome message, a section for level selection, and a section for instructions.
Each level button has an onclick event that triggers the startGame function defined in the JavaScript file (script.js).
CSS Styling
CSS: The CSS file (styles.css) styles the HTML elements to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
The body selector sets the font, background color, and removes default margins and padding.
The .container class centers the content and adds styling such as padding, border-radius, and box-shadow to create a card-like appearance.
The h1 and p elements are styled to set the color and appearance of the text.
The .level-selection class adds margin around the level selection section.
The .level-button class styles the buttons with padding, border-radius, cursor changes on hover, and a transition effect.
The .instructions class styles the instruction list to make it clear and easy to read.
JavaScript Functionality
JavaScript: The JavaScript file (script.js) adds interactivity to the page.
The startGame function is triggered when a level button is clicked. It takes the selected level as an argument and currently shows an alert with the selected level. In a complete game, this function would initialize the game at the chosen difficulty level.
A keydown event listener is set up to handle keyboard controls. This is a placeholder function that logs the arrow key presses to the console. In the actual game, this would control the player's movements within the maze.
How It All Works Together
Landing Page Display: When a player visits the page, they see the title, welcome message, level selection buttons, and instructions.
Level Selection: The player selects a difficulty level by clicking one of the buttons (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme). This triggers the startGame function, which currently shows an alert but would typically start the game at the selected difficulty.
Keyboard Controls: The page listens for arrow key presses (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight). These controls are placeholders and log the direction to the console. In the actual game, these would move the player through the maze.
Future Implementation
In a complete game:

The startGame function would redirect the player to the actual game page or initialize the maze on the same page.
The keyboard controls would be implemented to interact with the maze, moving the player character based on the key presses.
Additional logic would be added to handle game mechanics such as collision detection, reaching the end of the maze, and progressing through levels.
This landing page serves as the starting point for players to understand the game and choose their desired difficulty level before diving into the actual gameplay.
